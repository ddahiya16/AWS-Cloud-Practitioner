## Intro

**Client Server Model:** In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)**, a type of virtual server.

**Cloud Computing**: Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Deployment Models:

1. Cloud based
    Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
    Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
    Design and build new applications in the cloud.

2. On-Premises
    Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
    Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
On-premises deployment is also known as a private cloud deployment. In this model, resources are deployed on premises by using virtualization and resource management tools.


3. Hybrid Deployment
    Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
    Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

In a hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure. You might want to use this approach in a number of situations. For example, you have legacy applications that are better maintained on premises, or government regulations require your business to keep certain records on premises.

## Compute in Cloud

### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)

It provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.
